### About
jQuery Injector allows you to inject jQuery into every frame on a page so that you can use jQuery in the dev console. 

Features:
- Set the jQuery URL to inject any version you want.
- Specify websites and page patterns to automatically inject into.
- Entry in context-menu to make injection even easier.

### Details
jQuery URL
A non-protocol encoded URL to the version of jQuery you want to use. A list can be found here.

Always Inject
Can either be a full URL (e.g., https://www.google.com) or part of a URL (e.g., "test" would match https://www.google.com/test, http://www.test.com, etc.). jQuery will be automatically injected after the DOM completes.

### Notes
Firewalls (like uMatrix) will block jQuery from loading until you allow code.jquery.com to load scripts on that domain.
